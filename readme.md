Write a function that takes a word as an argument and return the pig latin value of the word.

Use puts to output that returned string value.

Description of the rules from Wikipedia:

For words that begin with vowel sounds or silent letter, "way" is added at the end of the word. Examples are

* "egg" → "eggway"
* "inbox" → "inboxway"
* "eight" → "eightway"

For words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:

* "happy" → "appyhay"
* "duck" → "uckday"
* "glove" → "oveglay"
